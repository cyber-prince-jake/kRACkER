## Features

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries every possible combination of characters up to a defined length.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses an external wordlist to attempt cracking the hash.
- **Hybrid Attack**: Combines brute force and dictionary attacks for more efficient cracking.
- **Rainbow Table Attack**: Precomputes hash values for words in the wordlist for fast lookups.
- **Multiple Hash Algorithms**: Supports MD5, SHA-256, and more.
- **Multi-threading**: Speeds up attacks by using multiple CPU cores.
- **Wordlist Flexibility**: Can work with any wordlist, including popular ones like `rockyou.txt`.

## Installation

To install kRACkER on your system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cyber-prince-jake/kRACkER.git
   cd kRACkER
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the tool, use the following command format:

```
python3 main.py -m [mode] -t [target_hash] -w [wordlist]
```

### Available Modes

- **brute**: Performs a brute force attack.
- **dict**: Uses a dictionary (wordlist) to crack the hash.
- **hybrid**: Combines brute force and dictionary attack for enhanced cracking.
- **rainbow**: Utilizes a precomputed rainbow table for fast hash lookup.

### Command Examples

#### Brute Force Attack

```
python3 main.py -m brute -t [target_hash]
```

#### Dictionary Attack

```
python3 main.py -m dict -t [target_hash] -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

#### Hybrid Attack

```
python3 main.py -m hybrid -t [target_hash] -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

#### Rainbow Table Attack

```
python3 main.py -m rainbow -t [target_hash] -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

## Wordlist Support

kRACkER supports any wordlist format, and you can specify the wordlist using the `-w` option. By default, it works with plain text wordlists where each word is on a new line.

### Adding More Wordlists

You can use any custom wordlist or download popular ones like `rockyou.txt`. Place the wordlist in the `wordlists/` directory or specify the full path using the `-w` option.

Example:

```
python3 main.py -m dict -t [target_hash] -w wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Wordlist Generation

You can also generate your own wordlist using the `generate_wordlist.py` script. It allows you to create wordlists with custom combinations.

```
python3 generate_wordlist.py
```

This will create a `common.txt` wordlist with 2000 common passwords.

## Hash Algorithm Support

kRACkER currently supports the following hash algorithms:

- **MD5**
- **SHA-256**

To specify the hash algorithm, use the `-h` option.

Example:
```
python3 main.py -m brute -t [target_hash] -h sha256
```

## Error Handling

kRACkER includes robust error handling to cover various edge cases:

- Missing or incorrect wordlist paths.
- Unsupported hash types.
- Invalid input parameters.
- File not found errors.

If any errors occur, appropriate messages will be displayed.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Multi-threading**: kRACkER uses multi-threading for faster brute force and hybrid attacks by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- **Rainbow Table**: The rainbow table lookup is optimized for speed by precomputing hash values for words in the wordlist.
